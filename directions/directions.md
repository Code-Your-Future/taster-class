Directions Game
---

This game is a simple problem solving exercise that requires the students to use limited instructions to direct a peer or a mentor around a set of obstacles.

Depending on numbers and space this can be a physical assault course set up by the tutors that students can view while they complete the exercise. Or alternatively, materials can be found here that will allow larger groups of students with limited space to simulate the exercise in smaller groups with a printed grid (Appendix_1).

As an outline the following instructions detail how the task would be completed using the grid and one simple path marked out in masking tape for all students to use at the end. 

Split the students into teams and give each team a student worksheet (Appendix_1) and an answer sheet (Appendix_4).

Explain that their task is to work out a path from the start to the finish of the grid and that red lines mark barriers that they are not allowed to pass.  

Once they have a clear path the students should use the answer sheet to program their path using only the grid coordinates and three instructions (step, rotate left and rotate right). 

Explain that like computers their mentor will only follow instructions as they are explicitly written on their answer sheet when they get to the path.  

The first three instructions should be the same for all possible paths on the grid so as a class go through these as an example and show the students how they should be written on the answer sheet.

Once on the students are happy with their instructions bring the group together and ask the tutors to take the instructions and follow them down the path.

For this grid I've found 4 possible paths - the instuctions for which are detailed here so hopefully this is replicated by the students and we can talk about how there are several right answers to the same question in programming - if not Appendix_2 and Appendix_3 can be used to demonstrate this to the class.

Once the exercise is complete bring the students together and introduce objects, methods and arguments using examples from the exercise to demonstrate how they relate to real life. 

The tutor was the object, the directions were the methods and the grid points were like areguments making the same methods more specific.
